#### Definition 68

An integer $r$ is said to be a linear combination of a pair of integers $m$ and $n$ whenever there exist a pair of integers $s$ and $t$ referred to as the coefficients of the linear combination, such that

$\begin{bmatrix}  
s & t 
\end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix}  
m \\ n 
\end{bmatrix} = r$

That is $s \cdot m + t \cdot n = r$
