[[Congruence]]

For all natural numbers $i$ and primes $p$,
1. $i^p \cong i \mod {p}$ (proof by [[Proposition 35 (The Many Dropout Lemma)]])
2. $i^{p-1} \cong 1 \mod {p}$ whenever $i$ is not a multiple of $p$

Proof of (2):

$p | (i^p - i) = i \cdot (i^{p-1} - 1) \implies p | i^{p-1} - 1$ by the prime factorisation theorem
