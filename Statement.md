A statement is a sentence that is either true or false- but not both

Example- $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$
Non-Example- This statement is false

A statement is simple (or atomic) when it cannot be broken into other statements, and it is composite when it is built by using several (simple or composite statements) connected by logical expressions, such as [[Implication]], [[Bi-implication]], [[Conjunction]]

**Examples:** 

'2 is a prime number'

'For all integers $m$ and $n$, if $m \cdot n$ is even, then either $n$ or $m$ are even'
