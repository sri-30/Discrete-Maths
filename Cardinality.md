The cardinality of a set specifies its size. If this is a natural number, then the set is said to be finite.

Typical notations for the cardinality of a set $S$ are $\mathbf{card}(S)$ or $|S|$

[[Finite sets]] are those with a cardinality equal to a natural number

Example: For $n \in N$

$[n] = \set{x \in \mathbb{N}| x < n}$ is finite of cardinality n.

In particular, $[0]=\set{}; [1]={0}; [n]={0, 1, ..., n-1}$
