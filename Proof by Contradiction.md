To prove a goal $P$ by contradiction is to prove the equivalent statement $\neg P \implies false$

**Proof pattern**:
In order to prove $P$

1. Write: We use proof by contradiction. So, suppose $P$ is false.
2. Deduce a logical contradiction.
3. Write: This is a contradiction. Therefore, P must be true.
