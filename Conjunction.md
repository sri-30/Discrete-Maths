A conjunctive [[Statement]] is of the form

> P **and** Q

or in other words

> both P and also Q hold

or in symbols

> $P \land Q$ or P & Q

### Proof Strategy
To prove a goal of the form $P \land Q$, first prove P and subsequently prove Q (or vice versa).

### Proof Pattern
In order to prove
$P \land Q$
First prove P and provide a proof of P.
Secondly prove Q and provide a proof of Q.

### Use of Conjunctions
To use an assumption of the form $P \land Q$, treat it as two separate assumptions $P$ and $Q$.
