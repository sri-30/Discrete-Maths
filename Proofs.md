# Key Words

#### [[Statement]]
A sentence that is either true or false- but not both
Example- $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$
Non-Example- This statement is false

#### Predicate
A statement whose truth depends on the value of one or more variables
Example 1- $e^{i\pi} = cosx + isinx$
Example 2- The function f is differentiable

#### Theorem
A very important true statement

#### Proposition
A less important but nonetheless interesting true statement

#### Lemma
A true statement used in proving other true statements

#### Corollary
A true statement that is a simple deduction from a theorem or proposition

#### Conjecture
A statement believed to be true, but for which we have no proof.

#### Proof
Logical explanation of why a statement is true; a method for establishing truth.

#### Logic
The study of methods and principles used to distinguish good from bad reasoning.

#### Axiom
A basic assumption about a mathematical situation.
Axioms can be conidered facts that do not need to be proved or they can be used in definitions.

#### Definition
An explanation of the mathematical meaning of a word.

# Definition, theorem, intuition, proof in practice
**Definition 7** An integer is said to be [[odd]] whenever it is of the form $2 \cdot i + 1$ for some (necessarily unique) integer $i$.

**Proposition 8** *For all integers $m$ and $n$, if $m$ and $n$ are odd then so is* $m \cdot n$.

**Proof of Proposition 8:**

Let $m$ and $n$ be odd integers: $m = 2i +1$ for some integer $i$ and $n = 2j + 1$ for some integer $j$.

$m \cdot n = 4ij + 2i + 2j + 1 = 2 \cdot(2ij + i + j) + 1$ which is of the form $2 \cdot i + 1$ and so $m \cdot n$ is [[odd]] by definition.
