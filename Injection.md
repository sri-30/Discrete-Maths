A function $f: A \rightarrow B$ is said to be [[injective]] or an injection, and indicated $f: A \rightarrowtail B$ whenever
$$\forall a_1, a_2 \in A. (f(a_1) = f(a_2)) \implies a_1 = a_2$$

Proposition: Let $X$ be a [[set]]
1. The unique function from the empty set to $X$ is an injection, and
2. it is a section iff $X$ is empty

$\emptyset \xrightarrow{\exists!u} A$ There are no [[function]]s from a non-empty set to the empty set
