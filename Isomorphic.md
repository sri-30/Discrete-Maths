Two sets $A$ and $B$ are said to be isomorphic (and to have the same cardinality) whenever there is a [[Bijection]] between them; in which case we write

$A \cong B$ or $\#A = \#B$

Examples:
1. $\set{0, 1} \cong {false, true}$
2. $\mathbb{N} \cong \mathbb{N}^{+}, \mathbb{N} \cong \mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{N} \cong \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}, \mathbb{N} \cong \mathbb{Q}$
