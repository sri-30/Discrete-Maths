An alphabet is specified by giving a [[finite]] [[set]], $\Sigma$, whose elements are called symbols. Any set qualifies as a possible alphabet, so long as it is finite.

# Examples
- $\set{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}$, 10-element set of decimal digits
- $\set{a,b,c,...,x,y,z}$, 26-element set of lower-case characters of the English language
- $\set{S|S\subseteq \set{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}}$, $2^{10}$-element set of all subsets of the alphabet of decimal digits

# Non-example
- $\mathbb{N} = \set{0,1,2,3,...}$, set of all non-negative whole numbers is not an alphabet, because it is infinite
