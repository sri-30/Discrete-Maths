Regular Expressions and Finite Automata are equal

# From [[Regular Expression]]s to [[Finite Automata]]

## Definition
A language is regular iff it is equal to $L(M)$, the set of [[string]]s accepted by some deterministic finite automaton $M$.

> Theorem
> - For any regular expression $r$, the set $L(r)$ of strings matching $r$ is a regular language.
> - Conversely, every regular language is of the form $L(r)$ for some regular expression $r$.
