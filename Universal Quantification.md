A Universal [[Statement]] is of the form
> for all individuals $x$ of the universe of discourse the property $P(x)$ holds

or, in other words,
> no matter what individual $x$ in the universe of discourse one considers, the proporty $P(x)$ for it holds

or, in symbols, $\forall x. P(x)$

**Example**
2. For every positive real number $x$, if $x$ is irrational then so is $\sqrt{x}$.
3. For every integer $n$, we have that $n$ is even iff so is $n^2$.


### Proof strategy

To prove a goal of the form $\forall x. P(x)$, let $x$ stand for an arbitrary individual and prove $P(x)$

### Proof pattern

Let $x$ be an arbitrary individual.

*Make sure that the variable x is new in the proof*

Show that $P(x)$ holds.

### Use of Universal Statements
To use an assumption of the form $\forall x. P(x)$, you can plug in any value, say $a$, for $x$ to conclude that $P(a)$ is true and so further assume it. This rule is called universal instantiation.
