The identity [[Partial Functions]] is a [[function]], and the composition of functions yields a function.

**NB**
1. $f = g: A \rightarrow B \iff \forall a \in A. f(a) = g(a)$
2. For all sets $A$, the identity function $id_A: A \rightarrow A$ is given by the rule
$$id_A(a) = a$$
and, forall functions $f: A \rightarrow B$ and $g : B \rightarrow C$, the composition function $g \circ f: A \rightarrow C$ is given by the rule:

$$(g \circ f) (a) = g(f(a))$$
