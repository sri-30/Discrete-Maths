### Definition
The contrapositive of 'P implies Q' is 'not Q implies not P':

$P \implies Q \equiv \neg Q \implies \neg P$

### Proof Pattern

In order to prove that $P \implies Q$, we prove the contrapositive: $\neg Q \implies \neg P$
Assume $\neg Q$
Show that $\neg P$ logically follows

### Example
**Proposition 10** Let $x$ be a positive real number. If $x$ is irrational then so is $\sqrt{x}$

By the contrapositive we need to show

$\sqrt{x}$ is rational $\implies$ $x$ is rational

Assume $\sqrt{x}$ is [[rational]], that is of the form $\frac{p}{q}$ for integers $p$ and $q$.

RTP: $x$ is [[rational]], that is of the form $\frac{m}{n}$ for integers $m$ and $n$.

Since $\sqrt{x} = \frac{p}{q}$ then $x = \frac{p^2}{q^2}$

QED. as $p^2$ and $q^2$ are integers.
