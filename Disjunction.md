A disjunctive [[Statement]] is of the form

> $P$ or $Q$

or, in other words,

>either $P$, $Q$, or both hold

or, in symbols,

> $P \lor Q$

**Proof Strategy**
To prove a goal of the form
$P \lor Q$
1. try to prove $P$ (if successful then QED); or
2. try to prove $Q$ (if successful then QED); otherwise
3. break the proof into cases; proving, in each case, either $P$ or $Q$.
