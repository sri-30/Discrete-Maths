Some theorems can be written in the form
> P is equivalent to Q

or in other words,
> P implies Q, and vice versa

or
> Q implies P, and vice versa

or
> P if, and only if, Q
> P iff Q

or, in symbols,
> $P \iff Q$

This is a [[Conjunction]] of the form $P \implies Q \land Q \implies P$

### Proof pattern:

In order to prove that
$P \iff Q$
1. Write $P \implies Q$ and give a proof of this [[implication]]
2. Write $Q \implies P$ and give a proof of this [[implication]]
